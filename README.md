<b><h2>My story</h2></b>
I was born into the gentle arms of technology. I was a highly competitive gamer growing up (FPS games) & wanted the best machines to game on so by age 16 I was already building computers & selling them on ebay/craigslist. By age 25 I was a certified network engineer via Cisco CCNA studies working with catalyst switches and routers. From there I started dipping my toes into hacking & cyber security. I graduated from CSUDH in 2019 with my bachelors in cyber security along with my security+ certification. I went on to work for SpaceX post-grad. In 2022 I obtained my CySA+ and SecurityBlueTeam BTL1 while working as a cyber security analyst for the City of LA. Soon thereafter I landed a contract with UCI as their Information Security GRC Architect and during that time I studied and passed the infamous CISSP exam. I currently work as a GRC Risk Analyst for University Office Of The President and plan to obtain the ISACA CISA certification in late 2025.
