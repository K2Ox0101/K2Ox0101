<b><h2>My story</h2></b>
I was one of the lucky ones that was born into the gentle arms of technology. I was a highly competitive gamer (FPS games) and wanted the best machines to game on so by the age of 16 I was already building computers & selling them on ebay/craigslist. By the age of 25 I was a certified network engineer via Cisco CCNA studies & home labs rocking the old catalyst switches/routers. Trying out various commands in the IOS to test out techniques like spanning tree protocol to avoid endless loops. From there I started dipping my toes in hacking & cyber security topics. I graduated from CSUDH in 2019 at the age of 30 with my bachelors in cyber security along with my security+ certification. I went on to work for SpaceX for awhile which was really cool then moved onto working for other places further sharpening my skillsets. In 2022 I obtained my CySA+ while working as a cyber security analyst for the City of LA. I feel this is only the beginning & I look forward to what the future has in store for me!
